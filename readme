# 📰 Fake News Detection App

This is a simple AI-powered web application that classifies news headlines as **real** or **fake** using machine learning. Built using Python and trained on labeled data, the app helps identify misinformation and fake news from text input.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Classifies news headlines or short articles as **Real** or **Fake**
- 🤖 Uses `scikit-learn` and a **TF-IDF + PassiveAggressiveClassifier** pipeline
- 🧠 Trained on a labeled dataset with thousands of news samples
- 🖥️ Simple and interactive command-line interface (CLI)
- 📝 Easy to extend with a web app using Streamlit or Flask

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer
- PassiveAggressiveClassifier

---

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rahuldsa/fake-news-detector.git
cd fake-news-detector

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
If requirements.txt is missing, install manually:
pip install pandas scikit-learn

🧪 Usage
You can try the model with custom inputs directly in the Python script:
from news_checker import check_news
check_news("The world is ending tomorrow, scientists say")

Or run the script:
python app.py
